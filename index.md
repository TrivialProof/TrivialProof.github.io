excerpt: "About Me..."

A collection of workings and interesting information picked up along the way towards a PhD in Theoretical Physics, specifically in the area of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes (QFTCS). All too often, I've found important steps omitted in material, and I thought it might be useful to fill in some blanks. Professionally interested in the propagation of electromagnetic radiation for communications. I also might post any interesting data analysis projects, for...fun?
