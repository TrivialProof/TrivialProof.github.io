A collection of workings and interesting information picked up along the way towards a PhD in Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetimes (QFTCS). All too often, I've found important steps omitted and I thought it might be useful to fill in some blanks. I also might post any interesting data analysis projects, for...fun? Professionally interested in the propagation of electromagnetic radiation.
