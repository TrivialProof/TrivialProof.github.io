# MSc Thesis

Abstract: So-called ultraviolet divergences create significant difficulties in the study of quan- tum fields in curved spacetimes, as quantities become infinitely large when two points of a manifold are brought closer together in their ’coincidence limit’. In this thesis, we follow closely the work of Taylor and Breen in their mode-sum represen- tation of the singular Green propagator - a term that captures all of these problematic infinities, by assuming the form of the Hadamard parametrix. A litany of methods are applied to divergent terms to regularize them appropriately, beginning with an expansion in "extended coordinates", calling regularly upon Legendre functions for their physical applications and reducing divergences at the coincidence limit to a mathematically useful sum of modes, capable then of being subtracted mode-by- mode to permit the calculation of expectation values. We then extend upon the pre- vious work and calculate some of the derivatives required to eventually calculate the renormalised stress-energy tensor.
